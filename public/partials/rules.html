                            <b>To Bereaved Parents & Grandparents</b> <br/><br/>

                            <p>A bereaved parent understands the pain that the death of a child brings. Grandparents can suffer that
                                same pain because of it being their grandchild and child hurting. I think its important Grandparents
                                understand what their child is going through and the best educators are the parents.</p>

                            <p>A Death of a Loved one is part of life as we were to understand, ''unless they were gone to soon''. Which in
                                most cases people can get through the grief up to few years with the right support and counseling. </p>

                            <p>A death of a child is lifelong, it changes a person forever, they can lose their identities. They feel very
                                alone in their Journeys, They learn to wear a mask, Some go towards alcohol, pills, drugs, We will not Judge
                                them for you have not lived what they went through, We will welcome them to speak freely so they know its OK
                                and really its normal if they don't have tools to cope.</p>

                            <p>Some feel very suicidal and if you see any suicidal behavior please contact admin. we would like to help them
                                and reach out to them as soon as possible. </p>

                            <p>We are all traveling the journey of grief and even though our grief is our own, the understanding, support
                                and compassion you receive from another grieving parent / grandparent is of utmost importance. </p>

                            <p>Grief is what we think and feel on the inside when someone we love dies. It's numbness, sadness, anger,
                                guilt, and sometimes relief, all rolled up into one. It's the pain in our gut and a hole in our heart. Grief
                                can be physical pain as well, we can have a lot of downs in the beginning process so be gentle to yourself.
                                With support from people that have walked in your shoes, they can help you through..</p>

                            <p>Mourning is expressing our grief, letting it out somehow.<br/>We mourn when we cry, talk about death, write
                                about it, punch a pillow or scream at the top of our lungs. </p>

                            <p>Everyone grieves inside when the child that was loved with such passion dies. We MUST mourn to begin the
                                healing process and to learn to live a much different life now. </p>

                            <p>Every parent is welcome here no matter how you have lost your child. </p>

                            <p>In no way does this group take any responsibility for your mental health. If you are suffering from
                                depression or if you are having suicidal thoughts, please call 911 or consult your physician. </p>

                            <p>We all know one of the signs of grief is anger there are times when we are angry and lash out but lets not
                                try to lash out to the other grieving person. Hopefully we will get through those times together. We all
                                look for a way to connect with our lost children or loved ones. Everyone has their own way of trying to do
                                this. For some it might be through religion, for others through spiritualism, yet others might not have
                                found any way. Whatever way you choose, its YOUR way. Please respect that we all have our own way, and don't
                                judge. Please don't think that your way is better than anyone else's, its just different. We have to accept
                                that this is how we are.</p>

                            <p>Its OK to bring up their loved one, they want you too. They want you to Remember! It shows you care!</p>

                            <p>Remember, grieving the loss of a loved one is the worst pain someone can endure. Be respectful and polite.
                                Don't discount anyone’s feelings. Even if someone puts on a brave face and looks like he or she is handling
                                it well, don't assume that person is. Show that you care. Actions often speak louder then words. You can
                                just listen and support. Offer to take them to the grocery store, watch the children for an afternoon, and
                                help around the house. These gestures mean a lot to a person whose world has just been turned upside
                                down.</p>

                            <p>You might ask a person 50 times to do something with you and they keep saying No, Just move on and understand
                                they are not ready, don't force them to feel what they are not ready for. Keep calling and trying because
                                one day they will say yes, and they will know you never gave up or forgot about them. </p>

                            <p>Hopefully one day I can incorporate a group for NA and AA here to help those who couldn't cope with losing a
                                loved one because they didn't have the tools so they have sponsor support. We will grow as we go along this
                                Journey, We are just getting started. Any Ideas are welcomed here at Angels of Eureka!</p>

                                hope for your tomorrow!</p>
