        <b>To Bereaved Parents & Grandparents</b> <br/><br/>

        <p>A bereaved parent understands the pain that the death of a child brings. Grandparents can suffer that
            same pain because of it being their grandchild and child hurting. I think its important Grandparents
            understand what their child is going through and the best educators are the parents.</p>

        <p>A Death of a Loved one is part of life as we were to understand, ''unless they were gone to soon''. Which in
            most cases people can get through the grief up to few years with the right support and counseling. </p>

        <p>A death of a child is lifelong, it changes a person forever, they can lose their identities. They feel very
            alone in their Journeys, They learn to wear a mask, Some go towards alcohol, pills, drugs, We will not Judge
            them for you have not lived what they went through, We will welcome them to speak freely so they know its OK
            and really its normal if they don't have tools to cope.</p>

        <p>Some feel very suicidal and if you see any suicidal behavior please contact admin. we would like to help them
            and reach out to them as soon as possible. </p>

        <p>We are all traveling the journey of grief and even though our grief is our own, the understanding, support
            and compassion you receive from another grieving parent / grandparent is of utmost importance. </p>

        <p>Grief is what we think and feel on the inside when someone we love dies. It's numbness, sadness, anger,
            guilt, and sometimes relief, all rolled up into one. It's the pain in our gut and a hole in our heart. Grief
            can be physical pain as well, we can have a lot of downs in the beginning process so be gentle to yourself.
            With support from people that have walked in your shoes, they can help you through..</p>

        <p>Mourning is expressing our grief, letting it out somehow.<br/>We mourn when we cry, talk about death, write
            about it, punch a pillow or scream at the top of our lungs. </p>

        <p>Everyone grieves inside when the child that was loved with such passion dies. We MUST mourn to begin the
            healing process and to learn to live a much different life now. </p>

        <p>Every parent is welcome here no matter how you have lost your child. </p>

        <p>In no way does this group take any responsibility for your mental health. If you are suffering from
            depression or if you are having suicidal thoughts, please call 911 or consult your physician. </p>

        <p>We all know one of the signs of grief is anger there are times when we are angry and lash out but lets not
            try to lash out to the other grieving person. Hopefully we will get through those times together. We all
            look for a way to connect with our lost children or loved ones. Everyone has their own way of trying to do
            this. For some it might be through religion, for others through spiritualism, yet others might not have
            found any way. Whatever way you choose, its YOUR way. Please respect that we all have our own way, and don't
            judge. Please don't think that your way is better than anyone else's, its just different. We have to accept
            that this is how we are.</p>

        </ul>
        <b>Things to Say to Someone in Grief:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Just call and say I was thinking of you</li>
            <li>I can't imagine what you're going through.</li>
            <li>I'm so sorry for your loss.</li>
            <li>I don't know what to say, I wish I had the right words to comfort you.</li>

            <li>She was so nice to me; one of my favorite memories of her was...(share a happy memory of the person who
                passed)
            </li>
            <li>Whenever you want to talk, just know I am a phone call away.</li>
            <li>She/He was so wonderful, she/ he be missed by so many people.</li>
            <li>I'm your friend—I'm here for you.</li>
            <li>If you can't think of anything to say, a hug may be appropriate.</li>
            <li>Sometimes just be with the person, you don't have to say anything.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Its OK to bring up their loved one, they want you too. They want you to Remember! It shows you care!</p>

        <p>Remember, grieving the loss of a loved one is the worst pain someone can endure. Be respectful and polite.
            Don't discount anyone’s feelings. Even if someone puts on a brave face and looks like he or she is handling
            it well, don't assume that person is. Show that you care. Actions often speak louder then words. You can
            just listen and support. Offer to take them to the grocery store, watch the children for an afternoon, and
            help around the house. These gestures mean a lot to a person whose world has just been turned upside
            down.</p>

        <p>You might ask a person 50 times to do something with you and they keep saying No, Just move on and understand
            they are not ready, don't force them to feel what they are not ready for. Keep calling and trying because
            one day they will say yes, and they will know you never gave up or forgot about them. </p>

        <p>Hopefully one day I can incorporate a group for NA and AA here to help those who couldn't cope with losing a
            loved one because they didn't have the tools so they have sponsor support. We will grow as we go along this
            Journey, We are just getting started. Any Ideas are welcomed here at Angels of Eureka!</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read our rules, we hope you have a wonderful journey here and we bring some
            hope for your tomorrow!</p>
