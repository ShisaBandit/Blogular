                <h3>The story behind the Angels of Eureka and the Circle of Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello I am one of the owners of Angels of Eureka! I would like to tell you how Angels of Eureka was born! So you know who we are, and why we started Angels of Eureka!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was through a horrific tragedy that happened to my family on Nov 11, 2010. I received a call that changed my family forever! When I picked up the phone, all I heard from the person on the other end of the phone line was that my daughter and her children were stuck upstairs in a horrific fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I lost all of them from this fire physically and emotionally! We buried our 3 beautiful grandchildren 12, 8 and 5 years old. We had no choice but to place the surviving child with his dad after a year and half of no one helping me to get my daughter, who had no insurance the help she needed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You see my daughter died that day in her heart because it was so broken. I will be writing about my Journey in the pages I am introducing to you! I figured out writing is healing. We have walked through heavy waters! With Abuse, Divorce, HUGE loss and drugs!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would love others to share your stories! Our website is very secure!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can start creating your own support network here in the website, which we provide to use for free!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our webmasters are working on a series of tutorial videos to help you! Our webmasters will answer any of your questions and help you with any problems..
                </p>
                <p>
                    God Blessed me with these two great men that heard my cry!
                </p>
                <p>
                    God has blessed me a lot on this Journey, and yes I have seen God move from day one of this fire! You see I can't do this without God. He is my light and he is guiding me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't know how to pick up the pieces of my life. I stumbled around numb inside overwhelmed with pain! I couldn't balance, all my children as they were falling apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My daughter got so bad she wanted to be with her children on the other side. You see she died first hearing her children suffocating, crying with fear after the explosion upstairs that knocked her off her feet and separated her and two of her children, one child burned alive!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My boys heard it too, while trying to get upstairs but it was too hot! Neighbors outside felt the ground shake after the explosion upstairs and everyone screaming!
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the boys finally felt a hand and drug my daughter's dead body downstairs and my son brought her back to life digging soot out of her nose and throat using the Emergency Medical Skills he learned that previous year!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have watched my daughter suffer with pain and grief for 3 and a half years not wanting to live, not having a reason to live and not having any passion or hope! How does someone live a normal life for 31 years and after something like this come back?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a mother, I yelled to God, not at God as I found my daughter laying passed out on her children's graves! I could find no one to help me for 1.5 years after the fire, because my daughter had too much to say that was the truth!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I learned courage, I gained strength because Love is a very powerful weapon! I went around to attorneys and people knowing my daughter had no insurance seeking help! Because I could not bury my child, I already buried the loves of my life! I couldn't bury anymore of my loves!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ended up writing Intervention TV! They flew out immediately to save my family! I felt like God threw me a life raft! A&E paid for the intervention and flights. A place called The Refuge in Florida gave my daughter a scholarship! The Refuge is one of the Top Trauma Faculties in our Country for PTSD, Survivors Guilt, etc. Our soldiers are sent there! These were my Earth Angels.God sent them to me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked in Holistic Health at the time of the fire. My friends around the country told me don't worry about the show. Look at the help they are bringing.That's what I did! I met the most wonderful people! This was real life! I have never been so afraid in my life!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Angels of Eureka supports a place called Onsite because A&E called them and they flew to our families aid. Doctor Phil also supports OnSite.They came with a team as well, and helped our family with a workshop for trauma therapy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those 4 days for me changed my thought process, and my family's life direction! One week of Trauma Therapy equals to 3 months of intense therapy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miles the CEO changed my life the minute he walked in the door. He let me know he was there to help me and my family but it took me to embrace that help! It took me awhile but I have learned it well!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miles showed me my life still mattered. I remember Miles pulling up a chair in front of me, looking in my eyes and saying I love you! Very Powerful Words!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Fact he said, he wouldn't be surprised if I became a therapist. That made me laugh!! All I can say is I have walked through it! I learned through the worse experience in my life with the tools that were gifted to me from all kinds of people that rescued me and my family!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Refuge told us not to take my daughter back to Texas for her survival would be better to start away from all of the trauma that happened before and after the fire! My husband retired and within a week of the Therapist telling our daughter that. Our Family landed in Arkansas because we have some precious family here! But we also have met some good people here, that tried to help us and catch us! I am grateful, Thank you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My daughter wanted a shop. So with the families help, we created a shop and called it Angels of Eureka, not knowing where it was going to carry us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So many people touched our lives we wanted to give back. We didn't know where we were going, We felt very lost but I do know more now because I have a dream!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So Angels of Eureka was Born in May 2013!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Angels of Eureka is a gift shop in Eureka Springs Arkansas! If you're visiting don't forget to come in and take photos of the murals with your friends/family! A must see!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our shop has painted murals inside to support our veterans from around the world that have fought for our country. Our kids received their wings on Veterans Day!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have a beautiful piece of heaven in our shop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the back of our shop we have a seating area for you to rest (back in the mural area) or just have a chat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People can come in and take free photos with their family and loved ones in the mural. Children have really taken to this. They all want a photo next to our life size Jesus! Makes me smile!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have an online store. For every total sale, we donate 15% to the Charities we support! We are very proud of this!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ask us about our Advertising? Or Partnering with us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As time went on and I met many families that suffered with loss, I realized I wasn't walking this road alone. This was a subject of hush...People think it's abnormal to grieve too long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grief comes in many walks of life. Grief is trauma in your life from losing a loved one, a job, a divorce, abuse, drugs! God gave me a vision, if I built it people will come!
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do you turn tragedy into a silver lining and survive through this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I wanted to die, I decided to live because my family needed me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    But how do you live again after being a victim over and over? You forget how to cook, clean, garden, play music, forget the passions you use to have, they are buried!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your Stuck? How do you go on? How do you move forward?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hopefully with Angels of Eureka being the umbrella for people to find help in one area, with the groups, the continuing education, Holistic Health Resources, NA and AA's, YouTube videos on Cooking Gardening whatever is positive to help people grow!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We invite you to utilize our website, like yours and its Free!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Tragedy Strikes people around you stay for so long and listen but they distance themselves because they can't understand the pain so they move on, and you feel hurt and very alone over that because you're stuck!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we decided with the help from our webmasters to build The Circle of Life!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I never realized having the wonderful life I had before, how many people out there in this world suffering. I never knew tragedy growing up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It gives you a new perspective on life! I asked God how can I help and to help me! We have been very blessed on this journey without knowing the blessings at first, in fact it made us feel sick inside, something has never felt right!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing I learned on this Journey was in the groups on Facebook my information wasn't as private as I liked. When you are pouring your heart out seeking help, you want to feel you're in a safe place..Predators are seeking you. So you have full control on what you build in our website!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We realized how many people don't have money to get help!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have seen several parents commit suicide over losing one child, leaving their other children and families behind! I can't tell you how many times many of us were calling all Angel moms to get that one mother off a bridge or something! That is Networking my friends!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So The Circle of Life was Born! We are still growing the website! We need you to help grow it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We didn't build the Circle of Life for profit or for ourselves! We built it as a gift for you to connect with people and use your gifts, talents to bring hope to many. This was built for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the children died, I couldn't move off the sofa for 8 months. I looked at the clock wanting to die, the only reason I moved was to help my children but I couldn't hear them because grief dropped a bomb on me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What pulled me through were the people that flew to our rescue, Thank you A&E and mothers walking through this pain of misery we call a life now! My wonderful Husband, my dogs and the people that cared enough to come to my rescue!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We heard so many cry wanting their loved one remembered and understanding it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we built a Memorial Wall site to honor the families, but as I moved along this journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We saw many move towards drugs of losing siblings and parents, grandparents. I couldn't focus this site in one area because God loves us all!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have heard horrific stories of murdered victims, suicide, illness and the list goes on. I started seeing how much pain is in our world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    God has a huge job, I would like to be his helper!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our government does not have the resources to provide so much on the mental health side!

                <p>
                    I worked from home for 8 years as a health consultant, guiding people worldwide to better their health after they got sick and prevention! The educating was all free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had foundations set up all over the world with the companies we worked with through their medical boards!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When this tragedy happened, I couldn't help anyone because I didn't know how to help myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stopped cooking, cleaning everything because I was too busy grieving and trying to save the rest of my family!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last 3.5 years I received my check monthly not working at all. What a gift that was for my family to have a continued income when our life fell apart my husband was forced to retire to save my daughter's life and the life of his family!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've seen several people after life changing events lose their jobs and they don't want to leave the house for a year or longer they move straight to depression!
                </p>
                <p>
                    They stop living because they don't know how to live anymore. They look for help online from the comforts of their home. It was too much of a shock, whatever trauma you went through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we wanted to build a place to bring it to the people! But it takes you to use the tools we are giving you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone has a talent here or a gift that God gave you, rather it be writing sharing your story with others, having a gift in starting retreats, cooking, gardening, other natural healing remedies!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is your website to grow within your own network you can add your links, you can have online groups, conference calls, upload photos, make videos and we are tied into Facebook!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So you're not leaving anything or anybody behind! Were giving you the wheel! If you have an idea and it makes sense, we will do it for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like people to start your own support groups/workshops it can be on anything weight loss, drugs, health, retreats, cooking, gardening, learning about the other side, bible studies anything to help people live again or walk where you have walked!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking for leaders! To bring hope to many!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have cooked for almost 51 years when this happened I forgot how to cook!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would love people to post your YouTube videos making your own shows with recipes! Same with gardening!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You build it within our website, they will come. We're giving you the tools without the expense coming out of your own pockets!
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was the most healing thing I did for 11 months, we with others helping decorated the children's gardens (Graves) for 11 months changing the themes every month!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We did this so my daughter, her surviving child, or anyone who hurt around our tragedy didn't have to look at the dirt where 3 children laid to rest!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't know how to stop taking care of them. No one did! However, we must keep walking forward! Hopefully you will find the tools within this website!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem when things like this happen to people, everyone is scattered and doesn't know where to land and one person could be offering a support group but it's only a piece of how to put your life back together..
                </p>
                <p>
                    People need life skills after many different traumas. They are on a new journey.The old one has passed..so we need a new normal!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Groups/workshops or other organizations shouldn't be jealous of other groups etc. because if you're in this for you alone to shine by yourself, people cannot get all the tools they need to live again!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Corinthians 13:4-8
                </p>
                <p>
                    Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. No one has all the answers! By people coming together, we are offering choice's and ideas from our website because everyone is walking a different journey! We will support that!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the person can find the right fit, we hope you have many to choose from!
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The Circle of Life is not about Death! It's about Celebrating Life and Moving forward! It's about life after the tragedy! It's about providing people with a place to go for answers.However, it takes Leaders from all walks of life!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can change things in numbers! But it takes you to build it, grow it and invite them inside!

                </p>
                <p>
                    God gave me a vision, I am sharing my vision with you! It's all about choices! People need help! People need to see your visions hear your stories learn who you are because they are trusting you with their hearts! When you give a part of yourself to help another..You will reap rewards!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am praying when my daughter decides to live, she see's the love and support of people from around the world that has come together because of our story, as she is healing!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can all be teachers if you have a story that changed your life! We want to hear about it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want my grandchildren to know how much they meant to us! I want all the families to know what you have meant to us! I am trying but I can't do this alone..It's a big request from God!

                <b>To Bereaved Parents & Grandparents</b> <br/><br/>

                <p>A bereaved parent understands the pain that the death of a child brings. Grandparents can suffer that
                    same pain because of it being their grandchild and child hurting. I think its important Grandparents
                    understand what their child is going through and the best educators are the parents.</p>

                <p>A Death of a Loved one is part of life as we were to understand, ''unless they were gone to soon''. Which in
                    most cases people can get through the grief up to few years with the right support and counseling. </p>

                <p>A death of a child is lifelong, it changes a person forever, they can lose their identities. They feel very
                    alone in their Journeys, They learn to wear a mask, Some go towards alcohol, pills, drugs, We will not Judge
                    them for you have not lived what they went through, We will welcome them to speak freely so they know its OK
                    and really its normal if they don't have tools to cope.</p>

                <p>Some feel very suicidal and if you see any suicidal behavior please contact admin. we would like to help them
                    and reach out to them as soon as possible. </p>

                <p>We are all traveling the journey of grief and even though our grief is our own, the understanding, support
                    and compassion you receive from another grieving parent / grandparent is of utmost importance. </p>

                <p>Grief is what we think and feel on the inside when someone we love dies. It's numbness, sadness, anger,
                    guilt, and sometimes relief, all rolled up into one. It's the pain in our gut and a hole in our heart. Grief
                    can be physical pain as well, we can have a lot of downs in the beginning process so be gentle to yourself.
                    With support from people that have walked in your shoes, they can help you through..</p>

                <p>Mourning is expressing our grief, letting it out somehow.<br/>We mourn when we cry, talk about death, write
                    about it, punch a pillow or scream at the top of our lungs. </p>

                <p>Everyone grieves inside when the child that was loved with such passion dies. We MUST mourn to begin the
                    healing process and to learn to live a much different life now. </p>

                <p>Every parent is welcome here no matter how you have lost your child. </p>

                <p>In no way does this group take any responsibility for your mental health. If you are suffering from
                    depression or if you are having suicidal thoughts, please call 911 or consult your physician. </p>

                <p>We all know one of the signs of grief is anger there are times when we are angry and lash out but lets not
                    try to lash out to the other grieving person. Hopefully we will get through those times together. We all
                    look for a way to connect with our lost children or loved ones. Everyone has their own way of trying to do
                    this. For some it might be through religion, for others through spiritualism, yet others might not have
                    found any way. Whatever way you choose, its YOUR way. Please respect that we all have our own way, and don't
                    judge. Please don't think that your way is better than anyone else's, its just different. We have to accept
                    that this is how we are.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Its OK to bring up their loved one, they want you too. They want you to Remember! It shows you care!</p>

                <p>Remember, grieving the loss of a loved one is the worst pain someone can endure. Be respectful and polite.
                    Don't discount anyone’s feelings. Even if someone puts on a brave face and looks like he or she is handling
                    it well, don't assume that person is. Show that you care. Actions often speak louder then words. You can
                    just listen and support. Offer to take them to the grocery store, watch the children for an afternoon, and
                    help around the house. These gestures mean a lot to a person whose world has just been turned upside
                    down.</p>

                <p>You might ask a person 50 times to do something with you and they keep saying No, Just move on and understand
                    they are not ready, don't force them to feel what they are not ready for. Keep calling and trying because
                    one day they will say yes, and they will know you never gave up or forgot about them. </p>

                <p>Hopefully one day I can incorporate a group for NA and AA here to help those who couldn't cope with losing a
                    loved one because they didn't have the tools so they have sponsor support. We will grow as we go along this
                    Journey, We are just getting started. Any Ideas are welcomed here at Angels of Eureka!</p>

                <p>Thank you for taking the time to read our rules, we hope you have a wonderful journey here and we bring some
                    hope for your tomorrow!</p>
